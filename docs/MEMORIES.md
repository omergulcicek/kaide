# MEMORIES

This file serves as a registry for critical technical decisions, architectural choices, and significant trade-offs made within the project, recorded as concise notes. The AI references these records to prevent recurring errors and ensure consistent decision-making.

## Update Cadence

- **When to Add:** Add a new entry immediately following architectural changes, extensive refactoring, new dependency/stack decisions, resolutions to recurring errors, or significant trade-offs.
- **When to Update:** Update relevant items when a decision is revoked or becomes obsolete, or append a "Superseded by ..." note.
- **Periodic Review:** Review this file before every major milestone or planning phase; archive or remove items that are no longer valid.

## Entry Format

Each entry adheres to the following structure. The date uses `YYYY-MM-DD` format, and the title should be concise, reflecting the essence of the decision.

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Concise decision title

- **Context:** The situation surrounding the decision (optional, include if complex).
- **Decision:** The action taken or preference selected.
- **Rationale:** Why this path was chosen (one line is sufficient).
